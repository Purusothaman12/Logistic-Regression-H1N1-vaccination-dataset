# Logistic-Regression-H1N1-vaccination-dataset
The main motive behind this machine learning project is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether individuals are vaccinated or not, based on the predictor functions available in the dataset.

Since false negatives must be avoided in the medical field, the main goal is to improve the memory score of the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (h1n1 vaccination) out of all true positive cases.

Using Standardsacler which removes StandardScaler, removes the mean and scales each feature/variable to unit variance. This operation is performed feature-wise in an independent way. StandardScaler can be influenced by outliers (if they exist in the dataset) since it involves the estimation of the empirical mean and standard deviation of each feature.
